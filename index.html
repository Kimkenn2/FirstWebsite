    <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
    <section id=ist>
    <p>I've always been interested in technology, playing video games for as long as I can remember.</p>
    </section>
    <section id=iist>
    <p>Back in 2017 I had decided to join the Robotics Club. We worked on autonomous robots using simple block coding and
        legos. But by the time the season was over, my team had placed in the world championships! This was my first taste of success in coding. But ever since then, I've never really touched more than simple code throughout highschool
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>After I graduated from highschool, I decided that I wanted to pursue Computer Science through Michigan State University! I got accepted and went through the entire process of moving in. Quickly I realized that this was not the path for me. I needed something that would get me into the same job field quicker. So I decided to look for coding bootcamps that I could go through.
       After some time at the university, I decided to take the leap in moving back home to study in a Coding Bootcamp. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is where I am now. This is my last project for coding bootcamp Flatiron's Prework segment!
